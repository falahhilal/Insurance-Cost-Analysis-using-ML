# 🏥 Insurance Cost Analysis using Machine Learning

This project analyzes and predicts **medical insurance charges** based on demographic and lifestyle factors.  
It demonstrates a complete **machine learning pipeline** — from data cleaning and exploration to regression modeling and evaluation.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Preprocessed raw data: handled missing values, converted categorical variables, and normalized features.  
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: visualized relationships between features (age, BMI, smoking status, etc.) and insurance charges.  
- Implemented regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression
  - Ridge Regression (with regularization)  
- Compared model performance using **R² scores** to assess predictive power.  
- Showed the effect of **polynomial features** and **regularization** on underfitting/overfitting.

- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **BMI**
- **Number of Children**
- **Smoker (Yes/No)**
- **Region**
- **Charges (Target Variable)**
